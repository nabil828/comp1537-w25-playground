### ðŸ“¨ Express Request Object (`req`)

Express.js provides the `req` object to access the incoming HTTP request data. It contains information about the request, such as the URL, headers, query parameters, and body.

#### Route Parameters (`req.params`)

Route parameters are part of the URL path and are accessible using `req.params`.

```js
app.get("/user/:id", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`User ID: ${req.params.id}`);
});
```

An example URL for the above route would be `/user/123`.

#### Query Parameters (`req.query`)

Query parameters are part of the URL query string and are accessible using `req.query`.

```js
app.get("/search", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Search query: ${req.query.q}`);
});
```

An example URL for the above route would be `/search?q=cat`.

#### Request Body (`req.body`)

To access the request body, you need to use middleware to parse it. For JSON data, you can use `express.json()` middleware.

You may also need to use `express.urlencoded()` middleware to parse URL-encoded data. This is commonly used for form submissions.

```js
app.use(express.json()); // Middleware to parse JSON body
app.post("/submit", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Received Data: ${JSON.stringify(req.body)}`);
});
```
