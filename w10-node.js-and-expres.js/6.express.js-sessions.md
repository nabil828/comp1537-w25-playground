### ðŸ”‘ Express Sessions (`req.session`)

Used for **storing user sessions** (login, cart, etc.).

#### Install Session Middleware

```sh
npm install express-session
```

#### Using Sessions

```js
const session = require("express-session");

app.use(
  session({
    secret: "mySecretKey",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: true,
  })
);

app.get("/set-session", (req, res) => {
  req.session.username = "JohnDoe";
  res.send("Session set!");
});

app.get("/get-session", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Username: ${req.session.username}`);
});
```

Sessions are useful for storing user data across requests. The `express-session` middleware is used to manage sessions in Express.js. The `req.session` object is used to store and access session data.

You might be tempted to store sensitive data in a global variable, but this is not secure as it can be accessed by other users. Sessions are a better way to store user-specific data.

On the client side, a session is maintained using a cookie. The session ID is stored in the cookie, and the server uses this ID to retrieve the session data.

Think about sessions as a way to store user data temporarily. For example, when a user logs in, you can store their username in the session. This data is available across requests until the session expires or is destroyed.

The browser on the client side sends the session ID with each request, and the server uses this ID to identify the user and retrieve the session data.
